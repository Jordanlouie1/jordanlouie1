This folder is for screenshots and images referenced by the portfolio README.

How to add screenshots:

1. Create a screenshot image (PNG recommended) with a descriptive name, e.g. `3DME-screenshot.png`.
2. Save it in this `assets/` folder.
3. Commit the file to the repository.
4. The portfolio `README.md` references images as `assets/<name>.png`. Once images are added, the README will render them on GitHub.

Suggested image sizes and naming:

- Hero image: `hero.png` — 1280×480 or similar
- Project screenshots: `<repo>-screenshot.png` — 800×450
- GIF demos: `<repo>-demo.gif` — keep file size under 5MB for GitHub rendering

If you'd like, I can generate simple placeholder SVGs or upload example images, but binary image files are best provided by you (screenshots from your running projects).
